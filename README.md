# LandingPage_Project
A landing page is a standalone web page, created specifically for a marketing or advertising campaign. It’s where a visitor “lands” after they click on a link in an email, or ads from Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places on the web.

Unlike web pages, which typically have many goals and encourage exploration, landing pages are designed with a single focus or goal, known as a call to action (or CTA, for short).
It’s this focus that makes landing pages the best option for increasing the conversion rates of your marketing campaigns and lowering your cost of acquiring a lead or sale.

some common examples of Landing Pages include:

1. Software Landing Pages
2. Product Launching Landing Pages
3. Ecommerce Landing Pages
4. Ebook Landing Pages

Here I have done a Course Registration Landing Page. A specific Course Launching Page attracts the customers to register for that course by highlighting the importance and advantages associated with it. The Course Registration Landing Page has several sections:

1. Header : includes Company(here I have defined a sample comapny), search bar, and some menu options.
2. About course : It contains breif information about course along with registration form.
3. Importance of Course : It contains industrial demand for this course and advantages
4. Skills : Includes skills that a person can gain while learning this course. 
5.  Ratings : It is the CTA key performance indicator where a customer focus on. It includes ratings from different sources and previous customers experinces.
6.  Footer Section : It highlights about the company along with its other services.
